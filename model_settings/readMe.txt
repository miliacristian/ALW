For the computation of the settings of models are used the following range of value for parameters:
    - Random Forest:    n_trees = 5, 6, ..., 20
                        max_features = 1, 2, ..., M (= all features)
    - KNN:              n_neighbors = 3, 4, ..., 20
    - SVM:              C = 0.01, 0.1, ..., 100
                        gamma = 0.00001 0.0001, ..., 1
                        degree = 2, 3
                        coef0 = 1.0
